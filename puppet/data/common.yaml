    # `wp_upload_proxy_url` is useful when setting up a local dev environment
    # for an existing site. It makes it so you don't need to download the
    # `wp-content/uploads` folder. If a file in that folder is missing on the
    # local HDD, then it will be fetched from the remote URL. To use it, set the
    # value to eg. https://example.com.
